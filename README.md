# Reliability-Benchmark

## ðŸ“Š Results

LLM output reliability is critical, particularly for numerical operations and action execution. Upsonic addresses this through a multi-layered reliability system, enabling control agents and verification rounds to ensure output accuracy.

Upsonic is a reliability-focused framework. The results in the table were generated with a small dataset. They show success rates in the transformation of JSON keys. No hard-coded changes were made to the frameworks during testing; only the existing features of each framework were activated and run. GPT-4o was used in the tests.

10 transfers were performed for each section. The numbers show the error count. So if it says 7, it means 7 out of 10 were done **incorrectly**. The table has been created based on initial results. We are expanding the dataset. The tests will become more reliable after creating a larger test set. Reliability benchmark [repo](https://github.com/Upsonic/Reliability-Benchmark)
